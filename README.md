# GitClips
 Since short clips of Twitch streamers have gotten quite popular on YouTube in the past couple months. I decided to make my own automatic clip uploader. I'm currently running it on my Linux server and you can see the channel [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNR6zkFCc4PsQtbtDjF02Lw).

 GitClips scrolls through the subreddit called LiveStreamFails, collects popular posts and follows them to the original clip at Twitch. At Twitch it receives some information about the streamer along with the .mp4 file. After receiving enough information it moves on to uploading it to YouTube, with custom title, description & tags.


## Usage
If anyone wants to use this code to host their own clip uploader, feel free. However, I do not offer any support on setting it up.
